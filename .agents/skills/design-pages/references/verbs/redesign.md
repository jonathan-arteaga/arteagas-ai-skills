# `design-pages redesign`

The user wants a different page from the same content. They are not happy with the current visual structure — typically because it reads as templated, generic, or AI-shaped. Your job is to redesign the page's structure, rhythm, and component voice while respecting the existing implementation boundaries unless the user explicitly confirms a full rebuild.

## Non-destructive implementation rule

design-pages redesigns visual and interaction layers. It does not delete production files by default.

- Never delete existing route files, component directories, page trees, or the old website unless the user explicitly asks for deletion or approves a file-level plan that lists the deletions.
- Default to in-place edits of the named page/component files, or additive new components/tokens wired through the existing route.
- If the redesign would require removing multiple components, replacing a route tree, or collapsing the app into a single new page, stop and ask for confirmation first.
- Treat PDFs, README files, `.md` briefs, docs, transcripts, and pitch decks as source material for understanding the product. They are not page copy by default. Summarize and adapt them unless the user explicitly says to use their wording verbatim.
- Before editing, state the files you expect to modify, create, and delete. Any deletion needs explicit confirmation.

## Step 0 · Detect scope first

Before anything else, decide whether the redesign is **single-page** or **multi-page**. The behaviour diverges hard.

**Multi-page signals (any one fires):**
- The target is a directory (e.g. `./app/`, `./pages/`, `./src/routes/`).
- The target is a glob (`**/*.tsx`, `app/*/page.tsx`).
- The user names more than one file in the brief (`./hero.tsx and ./pricing.tsx`).
- The user says "the whole site", "every page", "the app", "all the pages", "the marketing site".
- The codebase has multiple route files (`app/page.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/pricing/page.tsx`, etc.) and the user pointed at the project root.

If any of those fires → **multi-page redesign**. Go to § Multi-page flow.
If none fires → **single-page redesign**. Go to § Single-page flow.

## § Multi-page flow

1. Inspect the selected pages, shared chrome, existing tokens, components, and design guidance. Establish one coherent direction for the selected product rather than rotating themes across pages.
2. Reuse documented decisions. Where a new direction is requested, state the proposed visual changes and resolve only missing choices that materially affect the redesign. User approval already supplied in the task remains sufficient for the authorized work.
3. Redesign within the selected route/component boundaries. Preserve functioning integrations, content meaning, accessibility, and useful platform differences. Follow the shared design language while adapting composition to each page's job.
4. Verify representative pages, responsive states, and interactions. Report outcomes and gaps together, rather than emitting separate contradictory page verdicts.
5. If design documentation was requested or verified source changes require updating an existing document, hand governing evidence to `design-md` through [design-md.md](../design-md.md). Do not write a parallel document template, invented tokens, or inline export blocks. A new document is not a prerequisite for otherwise authorized redesign work.

## § Single-page flow


(The classic redesign behaviour — unchanged.)

**What to preserve:**
- The copy intent, factual claims, product names, and primary message. Preserve exact wording only when it already lives in the target UI or the user explicitly asks for verbatim copy.
- The information architecture (which sections exist, in roughly what order)
- The brand (colours and fonts they've named, if any)
- The primary action
- The existing route/component ownership boundaries, unless the user has approved a full rebuild

**What to replace:**
- The structural fingerprint — pick a **different** combination from [`structure.md`](../structure.md) than the source had.
- The component voice — different button style, different divider language, different image treatment.
- The reveal pattern — if the original faded everything in on scroll, the new one might have no reveals at all.
- The visual rhythm — different sections having different padding, different alignments, deliberate breaks.

**What not to replace without confirmation:**
- Route trees, production component directories, or the old website's file structure.
- Working app logic, data fetching, auth, forms, analytics, or integration code.
- Existing copy with pasted text from PDFs, docs, or markdown files unless the user requested verbatim copy.

**Optional `--mood <name>` argument:**

If the user specifies a mood (`design-pages redesign ./hero.tsx --mood luxury`), pick a tone aligned to that mood and let it drive the structural fingerprint. Mood names map to tones from [`typography.md`](../typography.md) and [`structure.md`](../structure.md). If no mood is given, ask the user what *feeling* they want — one word — and proceed.

**Genre escape hatch.** If the user explicitly asks for a *kind* of design that the current genre doesn't fit (e.g. "redesign this editorial page as a modern SaaS hero"), switch genre too. Load [`genres/<new-genre>.md`](../genres/) and apply its rule overlay. Stamp the new genre into the output so future runs respect it.

**Project-level check.** Before treating this as a true single-page redesign, look for `design.md` at the project root. If it exists, the project is being designed as an app and **the single-page rules don't apply** — read `design.md` and follow it instead. The diversification rule reverses (consistency wins). If you actually want to break from the locked system, resolve the authorized design change and hand documentation updates to `design-md`.

**Output:**

Return the redesigned code, plus a short note explaining:

- The structural fingerprint you picked, axis by axis.
- Why this combination fits the brief better than the original.
- One thing you removed and why.
- (If genre changed) why the new genre fits the user's stated kind of design.
