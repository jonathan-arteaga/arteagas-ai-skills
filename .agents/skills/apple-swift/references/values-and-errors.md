# Swift reference

## 1. Model data with value types

Value types are the default in Swift, not a special case.

- **Default to `struct` and `enum`. Use `class` only for identity, shared mutable state, inheritance, or resource lifetime.** A window, a database connection, an entity stored in a rendering engine — those have identity. A `Point`, a `Drink`, a `Material` does not.
- **`let` by default; `var` only when you mutate.** This is the same discipline as `some` before `any` and value before reference: start narrow, widen with cause.
- **A struct with a mutable reference-type property is neither a value nor a reference.** Copies share the object; mutations leak across copies. Either keep the referenced type immutable, expose only computed properties that forward to it, or make it a `private` stored property behind copy-on-write.
- **Copy-on-write is how you get out-of-line storage _and_ value semantics.** Wrap a final class in a struct and check `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&storage)` before mutating; copy first if it isn't. This is exactly how `Array`, `String`, and `Dictionary` work.
- **Enums are the tool for "a fixed set of things" and for mutually exclusive state.** Replacing a pile of optional stored properties (`isSharing`, `selectedRows`, `shareTarget`) with one `enum State` makes invalid combinations unrepresentable and makes state change atomic instead of a sequence of property writes you can forget to finish.
- **Composing values yields a value.** A struct whose stored properties are all value types has value semantics for free — which is what makes undo, diffing, and state restoration a single code path instead of one per property.

```swift
struct Material {                       // value semantics preserved
  var roughness: Double
  private var _texture: Texture         // a class

  var color: Color {
    get { _texture.color }
    set {
      if !isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_texture) { _texture = Texture(copying: _texture) }
      _texture.color = newValue
    }
  }
}
```

**Noncopyable types** (`~Copyable`) express unique ownership: a file descriptor, a bank transfer, an open resource. Suppressing the copy turns "you must not run this twice" from an assertion into a compile error, and makes `deinit` on a struct meaningful. Mark the finishing method `consuming` so the compiler proves it's the last use. Parameter ownership becomes explicit: `borrowing` (read-only, the default), `consuming` (takes it away), `inout`/`mutating` (temporary write access).

## 2. Errors and optionals — make the failure paths visible

Swift error handling rests on three points: sources of error are marked so they can't surprise you; errors carry enough context to act on; and **recoverable errors are different from programmer mistakes**.

- **Recoverable → `throw`. Programmer mistake → `precondition`/`fatalError`.** A failed network call keeps the program running. An out-of-bounds index means the code is wrong and must halt before the bug becomes a security issue.
- **Enums with associated values make the best error types.** `case duplicateFriend(String)` beats `case duplicateFriend` — the context is the whole point.
- **`guard` for error conditions**, because it forces the exit path. `if let` for the ordinary unwrap.
- **Typed throws (`throws(MyError)`) are for internal functions, error-forwarding generic code, and constrained environments** where boxing `any Error` is too costly. For public API, untyped `throws` preserves your freedom to change the error type later. Note the unification: `throws` is `throws(any Error)`, and non-throwing is `throws(Never)` — which is what lets `map` abstract over both.
- **Force-unwrap only where you can state the invariant**, and prefer a failing `#require`/`precondition` with a message over a bare `!`.
